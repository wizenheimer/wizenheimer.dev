[Luffy](https://github.com/wizenheimer/luffy) is a lightweight and incremental persistent database project implemented in the Go. It starts with a simple B-Tree structure and eventually transforms into a miniature database. This project is designed to serve as a learning resource and a foundation for understanding the fundamental concepts behind persistent storage systems.
