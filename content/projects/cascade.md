[Cascade](https://github.com/wizenheimer/cascade) is a chaos engineering tool that deliberately breaks your Kubernetes applications to uncover system weaknesses before they cause real outages. It runs controlled experiments around pod termination, node failures, and cluster disruptions, letting you simulate failures in a safe environment. Built with configurable scenarios and runtimes to test system resilience, similar to Netflix's Chaos Monkey.
