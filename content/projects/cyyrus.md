[Cyyrus](https://github.com/wizenheimer/cyyrus) transforms unstructured data (PDFs, images, text) into usable datasets through composable, declarative pipelines - similar to how Terraform manages infrastructure. It uses YAML configurations to define parsing, generation, and extraction tasks, building datasets like Lego bricks. Unlike other tools that create data silos, Cyyrus charges for transformations rather than storage, encouraging data movement rather than lock-in.
