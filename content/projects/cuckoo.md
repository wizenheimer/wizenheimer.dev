A [Cuckoo](https://github.com/wizenheimer/cuckoo) filter implementation in Go that offers probabilistic set membership testing, similar to Bloom filters but with support for element deletion and dynamic resizing. Named after the cuckoo bird's nest-eviction behavior, it uses cuckoo hashing with two hash functions to manage element displacement in its buckets. The implementation focuses on performance optimization through cached hash information and bit masking, while handling the classic space-performance tradeoffs of probabilistic data structures.
