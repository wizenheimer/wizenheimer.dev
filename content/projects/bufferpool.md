A Go implementation of a database [buffer pool](https://github.com/wizenheimer/bufferpool) that optimizes disk I/O by caching frequently accessed data pages in memory. It demonstrates the tradeoffs between traditional buffer pool management and memory-mapped (mmap) approaches, focusing on controlled caching strategies and replacement policies. The implementation prioritizes predictable performance over the simplicity of mmap, with explicit management of page eviction and write buffering.
