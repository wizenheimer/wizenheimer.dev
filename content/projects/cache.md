A Go [implementation](https://github.com/wizenheimer/cache) of four cache replacement strategies: FIFO for simplicity and fairness, LRU for temporal locality, CLOCK for efficient LRU approximation, and LFU for frequency-based eviction. Each policy makes different tradeoffs between implementation complexity, memory usage, and hit rate optimization based on access patterns.
